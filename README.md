# Unveiling Economic Disparities in the United States: A Visual Analysis of IPUMS USA Data (2006-2021)

#### Xixuan Li
Within this data visualisation notebook, the analysis delves into US wealth disparities utilizing IPUMS USA data spanning 2006 to 2021 (excluding 2020 due to the pandemic). IPUMS USA, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, offers an invaluable collection of U.S. Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data. The Census, conducted once every decade, compels nearly everyone to participate, yielding a comprehensive snapshot of the population's characteristics. In contrast, ACS is a yearly survey that captures data from approximately 1% of the population annually. However, the custom density comprises approximately 0.5% of what the ACS offers, emphasizing that the visualization isn't strictly representative of the ACS due to the smaller sample size. The dataset used in this study contains 421,998 rows, showcasing a remarkable equilibrium in the distribution of rows across different years. For detailed year-specific figures, please refer to the accompanying graph. This notebook will explore economic inequality involving race, gender, and education. The goal is to synthesise economic patterns into comprehensible visuals, providing insights into the multifaceted variables influencing wealth disparities.
